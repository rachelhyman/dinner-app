About
==========
A lot of my recipes use the same ingredients, but I always have trouble deciding what to make for dinner. If I have to go to the grocery store, I don't want to have to buy a lot of stuff. So I'm building an app that lets me check off what I have in my fridge and gives me options for what to go buy and cook. Very much still a work in progress.
